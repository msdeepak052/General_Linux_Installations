Perform change at /usr/lib/systemd/system/jenkins.service:

sudo vi /usr/lib/systemd/system/jenkins.service
Update like this:

Environment="JENKINS_PORT=6111"
And run:

sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl restart jenkins
And then try to access. It will work.


-----------------------------------------------------------------

The error message you're encountering indicates that the directory /etc/systemd/system/jenkins.service.d/ does not exist, which is preventing you from creating an override configuration for the Jenkins service.

To resolve this issue, you can manually create the necessary directory structure before editing the service configuration. Here are the steps you can follow:

Create the directory:
You need to create the jenkins.service.d directory. You can do this with the following command:
bash

Copy Code
sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/jenkins.service.d/
The -p option ensures that the parent directories are created as needed.
Edit the service configuration:
After creating the directory, you can now edit the Jenkins service configuration using:
bash

Copy Code
sudo systemctl edit jenkins
This command will open a text editor where you can add your override settings.
Reload the systemd manager configuration:
After making changes, you should reload the systemd configuration to apply the changes:
bash

Copy Code
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
Restart the Jenkins service (if necessary):
If your changes require the Jenkins service to be restarted, you can do so with:
bash

Copy Code
sudo systemctl restart jenkins
By following these steps, you should be able to successfully create an override configuration for the Jenkins service.

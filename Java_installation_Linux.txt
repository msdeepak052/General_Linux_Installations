sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel

2. Install Java 11:

sudo yum install java-11-openjdk-devel

3. Check installed versions:

After installation, you can verify the installed versions with:

java -version

4. Switch between Java versions:

To switch between the installed versions, use the alternatives command:

sudo alternatives --config java

5. To remove Java from a Red Hat Linux machine, you can use the following commands:

 rpm -qa | grep jdk
jdk1.8.0_131-1.8.0_131-fcs.x86_64
 yum remove jdk1.8.0_131*

6. Remove Java 8:

sudo yum remove java-1.8.0-openjdk*

7. Remove Java 11:

sudo yum remove java-11-openjdk*

8.To check which packages or software are installed on your Linux system, you can use the following commands, depending on your package manager.

For Red Hat-based systems(using yum)
Using yum:
yum list installed

For Debian-based systems (using apt):

dpkg --list

9. To check specific installed software:

To install Oracle JDK 11 on a Red Hat-based Linux system, follow the steps below:

1. Download Oracle JDK 11:
Go to the Oracle JDK 11 Downloads page (https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java11 ) and download the .rpm package for Linux. You can also download it via the terminal using wget.

For example, run the command to download the JDK 11 .rpm (update the link if necessary):

wget https://download.oracle.com/java/11/latest/jdk-11_linux-x64_bin.rpm

2. Install Oracle JDK 11:
Once downloaded, install the .rpm package using yum:

sudo yum localinstall jdk-11_linux-x64_bin.rpm

3. Set Oracle JDK 11 as the Default JDK:
Configure Oracle JDK 11 as the default Java version using the alternatives system:

sudo alternatives --install /usr/bin/java java /usr/java/jdk-11/bin/java 2000
You can switch between installed versions of Java by running:

sudo alternatives --config java
Select Oracle JDK 11 from the list.

4. Verify the Installation:
Check that Oracle JDK 11 is correctly installed and set as the default:

java -version
You should see output like:


java version "11.0.17" 2024-XX-XX LTS
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 11.0.17+8-LTS)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 11.0.17+8-LTS, mixed mode)

5. Set JAVA_HOME Environment Variable (Optional):
To set the JAVA_HOME environment variable for Oracle JDK 11:


export JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk-11
export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH

You can add these lines to ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile to make the changes permanent:
